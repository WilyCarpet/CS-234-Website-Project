# CS-234-Website-Project
A project for my CS 234 Database and WebSystems Development class where I used HTML, PHP and SQL to create my website called "Picture Talk."

This is the login page where I take in a username and password from the user and use PHP to communiate with a SQL database that has a record of usernames and passwords. The PHP checks if the password matches the password stored with the input username. If correct then it will redirect the user to the Home page.
